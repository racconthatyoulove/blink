## 🏗️ Core Language Features

### 📊 Data Types & Variables

**Numbers** (Floating-Point Precision)
- Full floating-point arithmetic (64-bit precision)
- Supports integers and decimals: `42`, `3.14159`, `-5.5`
- Perfect for mathematical calculations and precise computations

**Strings** (Text & Messages)
- Enclosed in double quotes: `"Hello, World!"`
- Perfect for user messages, data labels, and text processing
- Seamless concatenation with other types

**Booleans** (True/False Logic)
- Simple `true`/`false` values for logical operations
- Essential for conditions and program flow control
- Automatic conversion to strings for display

### 🔢 Arithmetic Operations

**Operators**: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division)

```blink
# Basic arithmetic examples
result = 10 + 5      # Addition: 15
result = 10 - 3      # Subtraction: 7
result = 4 * 6       # Multiplication: 24
result = 15 / 3      # Division: 5.0
```
**Features:**
- Full floating-point precision for accurate calculations
- Proper operator precedence (`*` and `/` before `+` and `-`)
- Perfect for mathematical computations and data processing

### 🔤 Special Features

**Flexible Variable Names**
```blink
# Variables can have numeric names
1 = "first"
2 = "second"
say("Sequence: " + 1 + ", " + 2)
```

**Mixed-Type Operations**
```blink
# Seamless string + number + boolean concatenation
name = "Alice"
age = 25
active = true
say("User: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", Active: " + active)
```

### 💬 Comments & Documentation

**Multiple Comment Styles**
```blink
# Shell-style comments
// C-style comments

# Both styles supported for flexibility
```

### 🎯 Control Flow

**If-Else Statements**
```blink
# Simple if statement
if condition {
    # Execute if true
}

# If-else statement
if score >= 50 {
    say("Grade: A (Excellent!)")
} else {
    say("Grade: B (Could Be Better)")
}

# Another simple example
if temperature >= 0 {
    say("Above freezing")
} else {
    say("Below freezing")
}
```

**Control Flow Features**
- Support for `if` statements with optional `else` blocks
- Clean, simple conditional logic with smart syntax
- Focus on single else - keep it simple and readable
- Proper block parsing with brace support
### ⚖️ Comparison Operators

**Complete Set**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

```blink
# Comparison examples
result = 10 == 10    # Equality: true
result = 5 != 3      # Inequality: true
result = 7 > 5       # Greater than: true
result = 4 <= 10     # Less than or equal: true
```

**Features:**
- Works with numbers, strings, and booleans
- Returns proper boolean values
- Essential for all conditional logic

### 🔗 String Concatenation

**Smart Concatenation**: Automatically combines strings, numbers, and booleans

```blink
name = "Alice"
age = 25
active = true

say("User: " + name)                    # Display user name
say("Age: " + age + " years")           # Show age with text
say("Status: " + active)                # Boolean to text
```

### 🎯 Expression Evaluation

**Parentheses Support**: Control evaluation order for complex calculations

```blink
# Complex expressions
result = (10 + 5) * 2        # Result: 30
valid = (age >= 18) == true  # Boolean logic
final = (base + bonus) / 2   # Mathematical operations
```

### 💬 Output System

**say() Function**: Universal output for debugging and user feedback

```blink
say("Program Started!")                 # Simple messages
say("User " + name + " logged in")      # Dynamic content
say("Values: " + x + ", " + y)          # Debug information
say("Result: " + final_result)          # Program results
```

### ⏱️ Timing Control

**wait Command**: Pause execution for precise timing control

```blink
say("This message appears immediately")
wait 1.5
say("This message appears after 1.5 seconds")

# Examples with different durations
wait 0.5    # Wait half a second
wait 2.0    # Wait 2 seconds  
wait 1.322  # Wait 1.322 seconds (precise timing)
```

**Features:**
- Supports decimal precision for exact timing
- Perfect for creating delays, countdowns, and timed sequences
- Simple syntax: `wait <duration>` where duration is in seconds
- Execution pauses at the wait command before continuing

### 🎯 Practical Examples

**If-Else Logic Example**
```blink
score = 85

if score >= 80 {
    say("Grade: A (Great job!)")
} else {
    say("Grade: B (Keep practicing!)")
}
```

**Simple Conditional Example**
```blink
temperature = -5

if temperature >= 0 {
    say("Temperature is above freezing")
} else {
    say("Temperature is below freezing")
}
```

**Complex Expression Example**
```blink
# Parentheses and complex expressions
num1 = 15
num2 = 20
result = (num1 + 5) == num2
say("Mathematical check: (15 + 5) == 20 is " + result)
```

**Timed Sequence Example**
```blink
# Countdown with timing control
say("Starting countdown...")
wait 1.0
say("3...")
wait 1.0
say("2...")
wait 1.0
say("1...")
wait 1.0
say("Go!")
```

## 🎯 Language Philosophy
