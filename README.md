- Perfect for mathematical computations and data processing

### üî§ Special Features

**Flexible Variable Names**
```blink
# Variables can have numeric names
1 = "first"
2 = "second"
say("Sequence: " + 1 + ", " + 2)
```

**Mixed-Type Operations**
```blink
# Seamless string + number + boolean concatenation
name = "Alice"
age = 25
active = true
say("User: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", Active: " + active)
```

### üí¨ Comments & Documentation

**Multiple Comment Styles**
```blink
# Shell-style comments
// C-style comments

# Both styles supported for flexibility
```

### üéØ Control Flow

**If-Else Statements**
```blink
# Simple if statement
if condition {
    # Execute if true
}

# If-else statement
if score >= 50 {

} else {
    say("Grade: B (Could Be Better)")
}

# Another simple example
if temperature >= 0 {
    say("Above freezing")
} else {
    say("Below freezing")
}
```

**Loop Statements**
```blink
# Basic loop with automatic iteration counter
loop 3 {
    say("hello")
    say(i)  # 'i' is automatically created and incremented (0, 1, 2)
}

# Loop with variables
count = 5
loop count {
    say("Iteration: " + i)
}

# Nested loops support
loop 2 {
    say("Outer loop: " + i)
    loop 3 {
        say("  Inner loop: " + i)
    }
}
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison Operators

**Complete Set**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

```blink
# Comparison examples
result = 10 == 10    # Equality: true
result = 5 != 3      # Inequality: true
result = 7 > 5       # Greater than: true
result = 4 <= 10     # Less than or equal: true
```

**Features:**
- Works with numbers, strings, and booleans
- Returns proper boolean values
- Essential for all conditional logic

### üîó String Concatenation

**Smart Concatenation**: Automatically combines strings, numbers, and booleans

```blink
name = "Alice"
age = 25
active = true

say("User: " + name)                    # Display user name
say("Age: " + age + " years")           # Show age with text
say("Status: " + active)                # Boolean to text
```

### üéØ Expression Evaluation

**Parentheses Support**: Control evaluation order for complex calculations

```blink
# Complex expressions
result = (10 + 5) * 2        # Result: 30
valid = (age >= 18) == true  # Boolean logic
final = (base + bonus) / 2   # Mathematical operations
```

### üí¨ Output System

**say() Function**: Universal output for debugging and user feedback

```blink
say("Program Started!")                 # Simple messages
say("User " + name + " logged in")      # Dynamic content
say("Values: " + x + ", " + y)          # Debug information
say("Result: " + final_result)          # Program results
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timing Control

**wait Command**: Pause execution for precise timing control

```blink
say("This message appears immediately")
wait 1.5
say("This message appears after 1.5 seconds")

# Examples with different durations
wait 0.5    # Wait half a second
wait 2.0    # Wait 2 seconds  
wait 1.322  # Wait 1.322 seconds (precise timing)
```

**Features:**
- Supports decimal precision for exact timing
- Perfect for creating delays, countdowns, and timed sequences
- Simple syntax: `wait <duration>` where duration is in seconds
- Execution pauses at the wait command before continuing

### üõë Program Control

**stop Command**: Immediately halt program execution

```blink
say("this will run with no problem at all")
stop
say("this will not be runned")
x = "hello"
say("this will also not run")
```

**Output:**
```
this will run with no problem at all
stopped
```

**Important Rules:**
- ‚úÖ **Works only at the top level** - must be at the beginning of a line in main code
- ‚ùå **Does NOT work inside blocks** - cannot be used inside loops, conditionals, or other blocks
- üö´ **Invalid usage examples:**
  ```blink
  loop 44 {
      say("hey")
      stop    # ‚ùå This will NOT work - stop doesn't work inside blocks
      say("hey")
  }
  
  if condition {
      stop    # ‚ùå This will NOT work - stop doesn't work inside blocks
  }
  ```

**Features:**
- Immediate program termination with "stopped" message
- Simple syntax: just `stop` on its own line
- Perfect for debugging, testing, and controlled program termination
- All code after `stop` is completely ignored and never executed

### üí¨ Interactive Input

**ask Command**: Get user input interactively from the terminal

```blink
ask("What's your name?") {
    name = answer
    say("Hello, " + name + "!")
}

ask("What's your age?") {
    age = answer
    say("You are " + age + " years old.")
}

say("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
remove = name, age
```

**Terminal Output Format:**
```
What's your name?
> Jeff

```blink
random(apple, banana, cherry, grape) {
    fruit = chosen
    say("Randomly selected: " + fruit)
}

random(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, a, 6, b, c, %, **, 444a) {
    result = chosen
    say("Random choice: " + result)
    wait 2
    remove = result
}

say("The fruit was: " + fruit)
remove = fruit
```

**Example Output:**

```blink
x = "hello"
y = "sir"
say(x + " " + y)

# Trying to overwrite existing variables will show helpful error:
# x = "new value"  # Error with instructions on how to remove first
```

**remove Command**: Clean variable removal for intentional reassignment

```blink
# Remove single or multiple variables
remove = x
remove = x, y, z

# After removal, variables can be reassigned
x = "heyyyy"
y = "woow"
say(x + " " + y)
```

**Features:**

```blink
score = 85

if score >= 80 {
    say("Grade: A (Great job!)")
} else {
    say("Grade: B (Keep practicing!)")
}
```

**Simple Conditional Example**
```blink
temperature = -5

if temperature >= 0 {
    say("Temperature is above freezing")
} else {
    say("Temperature is below freezing")
}
```

# Parentheses and complex expressions
num1 = 15
num2 = 20
result = (num1 + 5) == num2
say("Mathematical check: (15 + 5) == 20 is " + result)
```

**Timed Sequence Example**
```blink
# Countdown with timing control
say("Starting countdown...")
wait 1.0
say("3...")
wait 1.0
say("2...")
wait 1.0
say("1...")
wait 1.0
say("Go!")
```

**Variable Management Example**
```blink
# Create variables
x = "hello"
y = "sir"
say(x + " " + y)

# Remove and reassign
remove = x, y
x = "heyyyy"
y = "woow"
say(x + " " + y)

# Output:
# hello sir
# Removed variables: x, y
# heyyyy woow
```

**Loop Examples**
```blink
# Simple counting loop
loop 5 {
    say("Count: " + i)
}
# Output: Count: 0, Count: 1, Count: 2, Count: 3, Count: 4

# Loop with conditional logic
loop 3 {
    if i >= 2 {
        say("High iteration: " + i)
    } else {
        say("Low iteration: " + i)
    }
}

# Variable-controlled loop
max_iterations = 4
loop max_iterations {
    say("Processing item " + i)
}
```

**Interactive Program Example**
```blink
# Interactive greeting program
ask("What's your name?") {
    name = answer
    say("Hello, " + name + "!")
}

ask("How old are you?") {
    age = answer
    if age >= 18 {
        say("You're an adult!")
    } else {
        say("You're still young!")
    }
}

say("Nice chatting with you, " + name + "!")
remove = name, age
```

**Random Game Example**
```blink
# Simple random game
say("Welcome to the Random Adventure!")

random(forest, cave, mountain, beach) {
    location = chosen
    say("You find yourself in a " + location)
}

random(treasure, monster, friend, nothing) {
    encounter = chosen
    if encounter == treasure {
        say("You found a treasure chest!")
    } else {
        say("You encountered: " + encounter)
