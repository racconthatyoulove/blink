## 🏗️ Core Language Features

### 📊 Data Types & Variables

**Numbers** (Floating-Point Precision)
- Full floating-point arithmetic (64-bit precision)
- Supports integers and decimals: `42`, `3.14159`, `-5.5`
- Perfect for mathematical calculations and precise computations

**Strings** (Text & Messages)
- Enclosed in double quotes: `"Hello, World!"`
- Perfect for user messages, data labels, and text processing
- Seamless concatenation with other types

**Booleans** (True/False Logic)
- Simple `true`/`false` values for logical operations
- Essential for conditions and program flow control
- Automatic conversion to strings for display

### 🔢 Arithmetic Operations

**Operators**: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division)

```blink
# Basic arithmetic examples
result = 10 + 5      # Addition: 15
result = 10 - 3      # Subtraction: 7
result = 4 * 6       # Multiplication: 24
result = 15 / 3      # Division: 5.0
```

**Features:**
- Full floating-point precision for accurate calculations
- Proper operator precedence (`*` and `/` before `+` and `-`)
- Perfect for mathematical computations and data processing

### 🔗 String Concatenation

**Smart Concatenation**: Automatically combines strings, numbers, and booleans

```blink
name = "Alice"
age = 25
active = true

say("User: " + name)                    # Display user name
say("Age: " + age + " years")           # Show age with text
say("Status: " + active)                # Boolean to text
```

### ⚖️ Comparison Operators

**Complete Set**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

```blink
# Comparison examples
result = 10 == 10    # Equality: true
result = 5 != 3      # Inequality: true
result = 7 > 5       # Greater than: true
result = 4 <= 10     # Less than or equal: true
```

**Features:**
- Works with numbers, strings, and booleans
- Returns proper boolean values
- Essential for all conditional logic

### 🌊 Control Flow (IF/ELSE IF/ELSE)

**Powerful Conditionals**: Full branching logic for complex program behavior

```blink
score = 85

if score >= 90 {
    say("Grade: A (Excellent!)")
} else if score >= 80 {
    say("Grade: B (Good job!)")
} else if score >= 70 {
    say("Grade: C (Average)")
} else {
    say("Grade: F (Failed)")
}
```

**Nested Conditions**: Support for complex decision trees

```blink
user_level = 75
has_permission = true

if user_level > 50 {
    if has_permission {
        say("Access granted: Full privileges!")
    } else {
        say("Access granted: Limited privileges.")
    }
} else {
    say("Access denied: Insufficient level!")
}
```

### 🎯 Expression Evaluation

**Parentheses Support**: Control evaluation order for complex calculations

```blink
# Complex expressions
result = (10 + 5) * 2        # Result: 30
valid = (age >= 18) == true  # Boolean logic
final = (base + bonus) / 2   # Mathematical operations
```

### 💬 Output System

**say() Function**: Universal output for debugging and user feedback

```blink
say("Program Started!")                 # Simple messages
say("User " + name + " logged in")      # Dynamic content
say("Values: " + x + ", " + y)          # Debug information
say("Result: " + final_result)          # Program results
```

**Applications:**
- Debug output during development
- User notifications and feedback
- Program state information
- Data and statistics display

## 💡 Practical Examples

### 🧮 Basic Calculator

```blink
# Simple arithmetic demonstration
num_a = 15.5
num_b = 4.2
result = num_a + num_b
say("Calculator: " + num_a + " + " + num_b + " = " + result)

# Output: "Calculator: 15.5 + 4.2 = 19.7"
```

### 📊 Grading System

```blink
# Multi-level conditional logic
score = 85

if score >= 90 {
    say("Grade: A (Excellent!)")
} else if score >= 80 {
    say("Grade: B (Good job!)")
} else if score >= 70 {
    say("Grade: C (Average)")
} else if score >= 60 {
    say("Grade: D (Needs improvement)")
} else {
    say("Grade: F (Failed)")
}

# Output: "Grade: B (Good job!)"
```

### 🎯 Comparison Logic

```blink
# Boolean logic and comparisons
score_a = 5
score_b = 3
is_higher = score_a > score_b

say("Score A: " + score_a)
say("Score B: " + score_b)
say("A is higher: " + is_higher)

# Output:
# "Score A: 5"
# "Score B: 3"
# "A is higher: true"
```
